# Sales_Retail_drops_down_alert
This project is about predicting the future sales of retail products using historical data and building a smart alert system that notifies when there’s a sudden drop in sales.

We first used a simple machine learning model called Linear Regression to understand the trend of sales over time. This helped us forecast upcoming sales based on past patterns.

Then, we added a unique feature — a Sales Drop Alert System. It checks if today’s sales are much lower than the recent 7-day average. If a big drop is found, it raises an alert and shows how serious the drop is (like Moderate, Severe, or Critical).

This system can help store managers and businesses react quickly if something unusual happens — like a product not selling, delivery issues, or unexpected market changes.

In short, the project combines forecasting and real-time alerting to help retailers make better decisions and avoid losses.
